# Introduction

[Pintos](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos.html#SEC_Top) is a simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture. It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way. It was used as a assignment in MIT as a part of OS course.

Doing this as an assigments would give you a clear idea on the various topics in OS. This Guide will take you through how to install Pintos in your native Ubuntu machine. Pintos is a very small operating system and can run it on a virtual machine. The tutorial will be using [Qemu](http://www.qemu-project.org/) to run Pintos.

Once you are finished setting up the Pintos you can start working on your assignments.
